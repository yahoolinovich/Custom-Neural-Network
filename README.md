# Custom Neural Network
A Neural Network made completely from scratch with Numpy that is training on the MNIST database.

Experimental custom neural network using sigmoid activation function and back propagation. This Neural Network has one hidden layer, takes in a training set of 200 inputs from the MNIST handwritten numbers dataset and has a 86% accuracy when tested against the test data set of 10 000 images. I plan to increase the accuracy in the future by potentially adding another hidden layer, adapting the method of initializing the synaptic weights or increasing the amount of images for training.
